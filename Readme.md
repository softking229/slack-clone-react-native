## âš  Note

Slack clone is built using `stream-chat-react-native@2.x.x`. This example won't work on [`stream-chat-react-native@3.x.x`](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-react-native/wiki#v300) yet, which brought plenty of breaking changes. We will publish a new version for slack clone soon. Currently we are busy with polishing of `stream-chat-react-native@3.x.x` :)
